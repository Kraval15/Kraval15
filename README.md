ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kuldeep Raval
  
I was a Modification Team Leader (Technical Project Manager) in the Nuclear Energy Industry which I loved but I have always been adventurous and ambitious so I wanted to try something new! 

I took a career break in 2023 to travel the world backpacking through Europe, Asia, America and Australia while learning Software Engineering!

I always loved coding and I was able to learn and improve my skills throughout my career break. I realized I want to try and make this into a career and I will keep working to improve my skills 
and get into the industry!
